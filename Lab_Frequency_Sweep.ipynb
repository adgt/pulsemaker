    "# Lab: Frequency Sweep\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is inspired by [Calibrating Qubits using Qiskit Pulse](https://learn.qiskit.org/course/quantum-hardware-pulses/calibrating-qubits-using-qiskit-pulse#frequencysweep) from the [Qiskit Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/). It's a short lab, but allows more interactivity for the frequency sweep portion of that chapter and helps showcase some of the features of Pulsemaker. Consider this lab a \"toy\" example that could work well in a high school setting. In practice, you wouldn't actually perform a frequency sweep this way as it would be inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "_NOTE_: If you are new to Pulsemaker, then you might want to run through the [PulseDesigner tutorial](Tutorial_PulseDesigner.ipynb) and the [ScheduleDesigner tutorial](Tutorial_ScheduleDesigner.ipynb) to be more comfortable with this lab.\n",

    "Okay, so you saved up enough money to finally buy yourself a single-qubit device for use at home: the _Qutron 1000_ (aka Armonk among those in the know). Your Amazon box arrived this morning on your doorstep, but upon opening the box you were disappointed to read this included note:\n",
    "\n",
    "> We apologize for the inconvenience, but we've had so much demand that we opted to send out devices without calibration so that we could fulfill orders in as timely a way as possible. You will need to perform a frequency sweep on your device to determine your qubit's actual frequency. Based on our manufacturing process we know that this will be in the range of **4.965** to **4.983 GHz**. Happy hunting!\n",

The red dot (üî¥) is the last schedule that was run and all black dots (‚ö´) are previously run schedules. You can modify the frequency by selecting that item in the schedule and clicking üìù (edit). The manual says that with auto-run you can just enter new values or use the spinner (up/down) buttons and the output should immediately update.
